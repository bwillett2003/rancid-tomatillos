# Rancid Tomatillos

## Project Overview
This project is a user facing movie catalog that displays movies by their promotional posters.  It allow users to view each movies current ratings.  The user also has the ability to add their vote to movies with the click of either the up vote or down vote.  The user can also click on the movie to be directed to more details about the selected movie.  The goal of this project was to become familiarity with React.  Through this project we also worked with applying React Router to make it a functional multi page application, and thorough testing with Cypress.
